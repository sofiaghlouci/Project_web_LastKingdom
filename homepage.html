                    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                    <p>The story setting begins in 866 with the Viking conquest
                       of York, when England is divided into Heptarchy
                       (seven kingdoms). The Anglo-Saxon lands are gradually
                       attacked, plundered and ruled by Viking Danes in many
                       areas. The Kingdom of Wessex remains the last stronghold
                       against the Danes. The story covers about 40–45 years by
                        the end of season 4. Season 1 covers the years 866–878,
                        season 2 from 878–886, season 3 from 893–900, and
                         season 4 takes place about 905–910.The fictional
                         protagonist is Uhtred of Bebbanburg.</p>
                    <h2>Why you should watch it </h2>
                    <p>
                    You should definitely watch this serie if you didn't
                    already watch it. You won't be disapointed because the
                    story is fascinating, there are a lot of actions,
                    twists and turns, suspenses.
                    It's also funny that's why the original version is needed
                    because without it you can't catch the humour and you will
                    at the same time learn words from old english or even
                    french and let me tell you that medieval french is worth
                    the trip !
