<<h1>History</h1>
<h2>A little trip back in time</h2>
<p> The Last Kingdom, Vikings, The Witcher as many series that describes the
  Vikings or takes inspiration of their style such as Game of Thrones.
  Depending on the serie, the story can be more or less far from reality.
<br>Indeed, the Viking era is quite unknown so the writters have a lot of freedom
  when creating the serie. The names of the kings or others characters for
  example are mixed from a serie to another because no one knows exactly
  who reigned during which period, or who is the child to whom,
  it is really mixed and hard to follow even for British or French kings because
  this beginning of middle ages era was not commented a lot.</br>
  <br>As I said before, this part of history remains unclear and the fact that
  Vikings used to communicate with runes doesn't help. They left no paper
  trails, only runic stones and heroic stories. So the historians tried to piece
  together the history of this people so we have more knowledge about that
  period.</br>
  <br>First, the name "Vikings" designate the people living in what we call
  nowadays, Scandinavian countries from the 8th century to the beginning of
  the 11th century. At this time Scandinavia was constituted by
  a multitude of small kingdoms and it covered the current Norway and Danemark.
  Those realms were ruled by "jarls" which corresponds to lords and by kings.
  To continue, each jarl has a clan and is highly respected by it because to
  become a jarl you have to kill the current yarl according to the stories.</br>
  <br>In the 8th century, there were a lot of wars between clans and kings were
  struggling to impose themselves. This century marks the beginning of the
  Viking raids.</br>

  <h2>The conflict between Danes and British</h2>
  <p> The basis of series like The Last Kingdom or Vikings is the conflict
  between Vikings and British. The difference remains in the fact that in
  Vikings we follow the adventures of Ragnar Lodbrock, an heroic figure of the
  Dane culture and his sons around the world (but mostly in England) and in the
  Last Kingdom the serie is more focus on England history during the period of
  Vikings.
<br> Everything started in the late 860's when the Danes began raids in Europe
especially in England which was at that time divided into seven kingdoms:
Northumbria, Strathclyde, North Wales, West Wales, Mercia, East Anglia, Kent
and Wessex, the whole territory was called Anglo-Saxon Britain.
Those raids led to a lot of pillage and bloodshed. They weakened realms of
England, some of them were even occupied by the Vikings such as East Anglia,
cities such as London or York were taken by them also.</br>
 <br> But British soldiers did not give up, they fought against the Danes
 although they were told to be the strongest and most cruel warriors the world
ever saw. That's the point of view that series gives us but actually there were massacres for sure but also
compromises, some kings gave land to Vikings in exchange of their conversion
to christianism for example.</br>
<br>Indeed, another main reason of this conflict is the religion because English
 were christians whereas Vikings were polytheist, they believed in several gods
such as Thor or Odin. For Europeans, it was not possible to treat, Vikings or Normands (men of the north) like they used to call
them, as their equal because they weren't christians. That's the reason why a
negative image of the Vikings is present on the european texts of the middle
age. They are reduced to acts of piracy, caracterised by the violence of their
raids and their "pigan" barbarism.</br>
<br>In fact, Vikings, in addition to being one of the greatest warriors of all times
thanks to their smart combat tactics and their bravery, were navigators,
merchants, farmers. Indeed, it is well-known that they were on the cutting edge
of innovation in terms of ships especially with the creation of the drakkar
which was one of the fastest ship at this time. Thanks to this efficient ship,
they were able to sail around the world to trade, and to acquire not only money but
also lands. Why lands ? Because as I said, most of them were farmers and their
most important wish was to find a fertile land to cultivate it.
Finally, this conflict lasted approximately three hundreds years and ended
with the reign of King Knut, a Danish King, that became King of England after
beating the British. He unified the kingdom of England and the kingdom of
Danemark. When he died, the two realms became independent and the story between
Vikings and British ended . </br>
