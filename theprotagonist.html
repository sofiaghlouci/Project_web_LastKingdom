    <h2> Uthred of Bebbanburgh </h2>
    <p> We can't talk about the Last Kingdom without talking about Uthred of
      Bebbanburgh. Played by Alexander Dreymon, Urthred is the heir of King
      of Bebbanburgh. But when he was little, his land was attacked by the
      Vikings more precisely by the clan of the famous warrior Ragnar. His dad
      died in battle and Uthred was taken as a slave by the Vikings because
      Ragnar didn't want to kill him. His venal uncle took the throne, and he
      chased Uthred to kill him and remain the only heir.
      He even asked Ragnar to pay him to take Uthred back but he refused and
      paid Uthred's uncle to keep Uthred. After that, Ragnar saw a light,
      bravery and boldness in Uthred so he adopted him and raised him as his
      son. So, Uthred grew up with vikings, he learned their habits, their
      religion, their langage and above all he learned how to fight like a
      Viking.
